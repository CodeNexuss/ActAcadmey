I found even some programmers don&#39;t have the knowledge of such; I&#39;m in&nbsp;fact guilty of this&nbsp;sin!</p>

<p>I missed out by learning a&nbsp;programming language first&nbsp;rather than trying to understand the computer on the hardware level. As programmers we are controlling the hardware and eventually even if you&#39;re programming in Javascript you need to know about memory and how the language works. So understanding&nbsp;binary data,&nbsp;persistent and temporary memory, CPU, SPU, GPU,&nbsp;networking and more&nbsp;is crucial even if you&#39;re a web developer this still applies to you.</p>

<p>This course will be a&nbsp;broad&nbsp;foundation of knowledge giving&nbsp;understanding of certain topics that need&nbsp;to&nbsp;be covered;&nbsp;giving&nbsp;you a solid foundation&nbsp;to grow from. I don&#39;t believe in understanding a programming language first is the correct way to go about things. Programming languages have evolved as a tool for us.&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;the computer! So if we understand the computer&#39;s hardware we&#39;ll understand clearly how our program&#39;s are controlling our&nbsp;device&#39;s.</p>

<p>Computers are tools that we created to benefit man kind, however as all tools we need to improve them more and more. However the core principle of computers from the very first computer ever invented hasn&#39;t changed. Over time the tool or computer has been refined. However the very core process and simplicity in underlying&nbsp;principles has been the same from the foundation of computing which is,&nbsp;processing ones and noughts. Computers have gone from processing&nbsp;8 to 64 bits at any one time.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;just the computer being able to process more bits and thus more powerful operations can be done at a single time.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong computers are far more advanced, but the concept is all I&#39;m saying is simple enough that even a beginner can learn what most people consider advanced and above their pay grade.</p>

<p>Likewise understanding networking is of vital importance especially for the&nbsp;web developers of today. More apps are going online so&nbsp;understanding network infrastructure, that has been around for over a decade, is still important today.</p>

<p>What about programming languages?&nbsp;We invented them as&nbsp;tools&nbsp;to communicate with&nbsp;these raw processing machines. We must understand why we have programming languages and how they work. For example what&#39;re&nbsp;compilers or transpilers?&nbsp;How have we taken our form of&nbsp;communication,&nbsp;<strong>human&nbsp;</strong><strong>languages</strong>, and turned it into an effective communication to manipulate the computer,&nbsp;<strong>programming languages?&nbsp;</strong>What about variables, constants, functions, objects and&nbsp;arrays&nbsp;that are in all major&nbsp;programming&nbsp;languages today?<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Also all languages have&nbsp;operators and if you didn&#39;t have them in a programming language you wouldn&#39;t actually have a programming language at all.</p>

<p>In this course we&#39;ll cover even more, what about programming paradigms. Paradigm just means a model on how to do something. So in this case we can write our program&#39;s in a certain way or in a certain paradigm.&nbsp;Very few beginners consider the style with which they program. When creating small scale apps it isn&#39;t that difficult, however when creating large scale apps, paradigms become&nbsp;imperative.</p>

<p>Most programming languages give you the flexibility to mix and match programming paradigms or&nbsp;styles for writing your app&#39;s. You have a few major styles to choose from such as&nbsp;assembly,&nbsp;procedural and object oriented. Do note in a single app you can mix these paradigms usually procedural and object oriented to best suite that part of your large scale app. I&#39;ll show you the styles of these paradigms and then apply procedural and OOP (object oriented paradigm/programming) to demonstrate&nbsp;how the human mind works with differing paradigms;&nbsp;proving that multiple paradigms are the way forward.</p>

<p>Finally at the end of learning such a broad range of topics in a clear and concise course; you&#39;ll also be learning about the licensing which should be covered especially for new comers. Then learning about software morality such as DRM, software patents and many other aspects of how the government is dealing with your data.</p>

<p>After all this, if you&#39;re still not satisfied you can have your 100% money back guarantee if the course actually cost anything. So this last bit is really the bit that sells it, what have you got to loose?</p>','benefits' => 'Count bits

<p>The reason I made this course is because there is a huge gap for many students between machine learning &quot;theory&quot; and writing actual code.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve always said:&nbsp;&quot;If you can&#39;t implement it, then you don&#39;t understand it&quot;.</p>

<p>Without basic knowledge of data manipulation, vectors, and matrices, students are not able to put their great ideas into working form, on a computer.</p>

<p>This course closes that gap by teaching you all the basic operations you need for implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>Do you wish you were able to write business reports, sales emails, website copy, cover letters or college essays with supreme confidence?</strong></p>

<p>Imagine, then, what it would be like if you could write with the style and flair&nbsp;of journalists on top&nbsp;newspapers such as&nbsp;<strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>The Economist</strong>.</p>

<p>Welcome to&nbsp;the brand new&nbsp;second edition of&nbsp;<strong>Secret Sauce Of Great Writing</strong>, a program that&nbsp;will&nbsp;show you how it&#39;s possible to upgrade your business writing, blog writing and copywriting skills&nbsp;to that level extremely fast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The course is taught by Shani Raja,&nbsp;author of the bestselling Udemy course&nbsp;<strong>Writing With Flair: How To Become An Exceptional Writer&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;a former&nbsp;<strong>Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</strong>senior editor and writing coach,&nbsp;as well as an ex-contributor to&nbsp;<strong>The Economist</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>FT</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Dow Jones</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Bloomberg News</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this course,&nbsp;Shani will introduce&nbsp;you to the fundamental four&nbsp;ingredients of exceptional writing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  <p>Simplicity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Clarity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Elegance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Evocativeness</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In as little as&nbsp;an hour, you&#39;ll&nbsp;know exactly how to apply&nbsp;this &quot;secret sauce&quot; to your own writing&mdash;putting&nbsp;you way ahead of other writers in your profession or industry.</p>

<p>&quot;Outstanding course from the get go...&quot;&nbsp;<strong>&mdash; Rudyard von, Udemy student</strong></p>

<p>&quot;A genuine recipe to produce attention-grabbing writing...&quot;&nbsp;<strong>&mdash;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Hassan Masood, Udemy student</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Revolutionary...&quot;<strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Marie-Rose Davis, Udemy student</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Priceless...&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&mdash; Alimaa Batchuluun, Udemy student</strong></p>

<p><strong>The secret sauce</strong></p>

<p>The first three ingredients in the secret sauce&mdash;simplicity, clarity and elegance&mdash;respectively make your writing&nbsp;<strong>punchy, crisp and graceful.</strong></p>

<p>Evocativeness is the fourth quality that makes your prose<strong>&nbsp;stimulating</strong>.</p>

<p>When you put those four ingredients together in&nbsp;a piece of writing, it&nbsp;will become truly&nbsp;outstanding.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In fact,&nbsp;it&#39;s the exact formula Shani has used for many years&nbsp;to&nbsp;edit&nbsp;articles devoured regularly&nbsp;by millions of people worldwide.</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps you&#39;ve always felt your writing was too weak to get noticed or&nbsp;make an impact. Maybe you&#39;ve struggled to figure out how to improve it, or even to know&nbsp;where&nbsp;to begin.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry.</p>

<p>This course&nbsp;will reveal&nbsp;the writing tactics of world-class editors in a well&nbsp;structured and easy-to-follow&nbsp;format.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll find that as soon as&nbsp;you incorporate those four&nbsp;ingredients (simplicity, clarity, elegance and evocativeness)&nbsp;into your writing, you&#39;ll see&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>seismic shift</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;impact&nbsp;of your words and sentences.</p>

<p>&quot;Helped me to see exactly what I needed...&quot;&nbsp;<strong>&mdash;&nbsp;Shalecia Tatiana Wallace, Udemy student&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>How many job interviews might you have lost&nbsp;because your cover letters and resume didn&#39;t hit home?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How many customers might you have&nbsp;turned off because the words on your website were&nbsp;too&nbsp;dull and uninspiring to read?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How many books or blog posts&nbsp;have you quit writing, or put off, because you couldn&#39;t figure out why your sentences and words lacked the&nbsp;power to captivate a reader?</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;ll find&nbsp;the answers to such questions in this course,&nbsp;your first glimpse into the wondrous world of elite writing.</p>

<p><strong>Not tips, but a writing system</strong></p>

<p>This entry-level writing&nbsp;course doesn&#39;t focus on the technical aspects of writing,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;grammar rules.</p>

<p>Rather, it reveals the powerful&nbsp;key principles that will&nbsp;enable you quickly to design&nbsp;more&nbsp;stylish prose.</p>

<p>Nor will you get&nbsp;a bunch of fragmented&nbsp;writing &quot;tips&quot;&nbsp;you could pick up anywhere on the internet.</p>

<p>This is an&nbsp;all-encompassing writing&nbsp;<strong>system</strong>&nbsp;that will change forever&nbsp;the way you think about and&nbsp;approach the craft.</p>

<p>Your&nbsp;essays,&nbsp;cover letters, press releases, marketing copy and sales emails&mdash;not to mention books and blog posts&mdash;will never look the same again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Most great teachers can&#39;t write, and most great writers can&#39;t teach. Shani Raja is one of the few who excels at both. I managed dozens of reporters and editors during my 12-year career at Bloomberg News. Now he&#39;s the person I go to when I want help with my writing.&quot;&nbsp;<strong>NICOLAS JOHNSON, FORMER BLOOMBERG AND GLOBE AND MAIL EDITOR.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;As a young reporter my prose might have been robotic and jargon-laden if not for Shani&#39;s watchful eye and attention to the elusive human interest behind ostensibly technical stories. Beyond the standard (yet crucial) reporting skills&mdash;like accuracy, clarity and integrity&mdash;I also learned refinement, how to withstand impulses toward glibness and cynicism that can naturally set in when oft revisiting the same beat. Shani will teach you how to write well, and with grace.</p>','benefits' => 'In this course, Shani Raja, a former Wall Street Journal editor, will teach you the four ingredients of good writing: simplicity, clarity, elegance and evocativeness.

By the end of the course, you will have a good grasp of how good writers create powerful and beautiful prose.

In the last year one aspect of this &ndash; the world wide web &ndash; has kicked up a gear with the introduction of HTML5, the newest version of the code that makes the web tick. If you learn HTML5 along with CSS3 (the next level of web design used on all modern websites), you&rsquo;ll have a recipe for success; and this course will show you how.</p>

<p><strong>Create a website from scratch with HMTL5 and CSS3</strong></p>

  <li>Learn best practice techniques for building websites and web pages</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Build Like a Pro with HMTL5 and CSS3 Design</strong></p>

<p>The only way to effectively learn HTML5 and CSS3 is by diving right in and building websites from the ground up. That&rsquo;s exactly what this course does. Designed for complete beginners, you&rsquo;ll create a complete website section by section during 35 lectures and 5 hours of content.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll start by becoming familiar with HTML tags and how they&rsquo;re used, followed by the use of attributes and common settings. Once you&rsquo;ve got a handle on basic HTML, you&rsquo;ll move on to the fun stuff: CSS. You&rsquo;ll use CSS for fonts, colours, lists, navigation menus, and more, adding a new element to your website with each section. Links, layouts, tables, forms and videos are all covered too.</p>

<p>If you know how to use a web browser and a text editor, you&rsquo;re all set up for this course already. No extra software or tools are needed, and you can choose your preferred option of each to get going. By the time you finish, you&rsquo;ll know everything you need to know to create beautiful, functional, easy to use websites of any kind.</p>

<p><strong>About HTML5 and CSS3</strong></p>

<p>HTML5</p>

<p>HTML or Hyper Text Mark-up Language is the language used for presenting websites and web content. HTML5 is the latest version, made official by the World Wide Web Consortium in 2014. Having a good grasp of HTML means you&rsquo;ll be able to create, present and edit a whole variety of content on the web.</p>

<p>CSS3</p>

<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) essentially &lsquo;enhances&rsquo; HTML, giving developers and users more control over how pages and content is displayed. It is responsible for creating more visually engaging web pages, applications and interfaces. CSS3 is the latest version, and has many more extended features than previous versions &ndash; although it is backwards compatible.</p>','benefits' => 'Know how to use Html tags and build with the most common ones.

<br />
<strong>- What is this course all about?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Front End Development is a trending&nbsp;<strong>job</strong>, engaging, well paid and full of challenges and wonders.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This course will teach you the skills to kick-start a career in Front End Development, assuming no previous knowledge of any of the topics presented.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>a basic knowledge of how to use your computer and run programs is assumed.</p>

<p><strong>This course is all about helping you changing your career path (or creating a new one) and acquire the necessary skills to jump into the job market as soon as possible.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you tired of courses teaching you skills that you cannot easily convert into a salary ? If so, this is the course for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Front End Development is an area of Web Development that includes all of the skills required to create the visual and interactive part of a Website. It&#39;s a complex mix of skills and technologies and one of the most fast growing and well paid IT sectors of the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Front End Developer is the link between the graphic designer, responsible for creating the visual design of a Web Application and the Backend Developer responsible for creating the computational logic behind the application. The Front End Developer brings the application to life creating rich, compelling experiences and allowing the user to interact with the data behind the application.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This&nbsp;<strong>comprehensive course</strong>&nbsp;is aimed at students with no previous experience with Web Development or programming at all;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The course was recorded on a&nbsp;<strong>Mac OSX</strong>&nbsp;machine; You can still benefit from this course if you&#39;re using Windows but you are required to have basic knowledge on how to use the Windows Explorer and create folders and files with it. You can easily avoid using the Windows command prompt (in the very rare videos that use the Terminal) and instead do what the video shows just using your WIndows Explorer (it&#39;s mostly creating folders and files).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>90% of the population doesn&#39;t know how to breathe.</strong></p>

<p>Studies show that most people are actually holding in negative emotions, tension, and nervous system trauma - and this results in what is called &quot;Shallow Breathing&quot;. Most people don&rsquo;t notice their breathing is compromised until 70 percent of the functioning capacity of their lungs is gone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shallow breathing has</strong>&nbsp;<strong>been scientifically linked with degenerative disease, poor quality of life, and an early onset of death.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, we can reverse all of that - with some simple techniques I&nbsp;am going to show you over the next 7 days.</p>

<p>After teaching this to professional athletes and&nbsp;hollywood influencers, I&nbsp;decided it was time to share this powerful knowledge with you.</p>

However, as we&#39;re now busier than ever running our&nbsp;Photography Tours, time has come to throw open the doors and let everyone enjoy it!

<h2>Who this course is for:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What skill level is needed? This photography courses is aimed at beginners right through to keen-enthusiast photographers. We start at the very basics (you&#39;d be surprised how often even skilled photographers actually lack some of these fundamentals!) and then work up. We&#39;re always delighted to hear that even accomplished photographers who&#39;ve done the course still report that they were surprised how much they still learnt. The main concern our guests seem to have before they do the course is that they might not be advanced enough, but let me assure you that this is never the case! We&#39;ve had people attend the course pulling their camera out of the plastic-wrap and turning it on for the first time, and they too find the course invaluable and still well-paced.</li>
  <li>Suitable for all cameras? Yes for sure! All the theory is exactly the same across all camera types and brands, and as you&#39;ll see in my examples and diagrams, I include the various terminology, mode-setting names etc used across the full range of cameras. While most of my examples are using a full-on DSLR camera, things like mirrorless, micro 4/3rd cameras and even bridge / compact cameras etc can do virtually all the same things - sometimes the features might just be buried in a menu somewhere, and/or the effects can be less dramatic - but it&#39;s all there, waiting to be unleashed! Even if all you use is a smartphone camera, there&#39;s still loads of tips you&#39;ll pick up on this course to greatly improve your photography - things like composition, lighting, exposure, practical tips etc - all that stuff 100% applies to all photography, irrespective of what type of camera you have!</li>
  <li>What makes this course great? There are many reasons why this course has become so popular, but the most common feedback is that it&#39;s just taught in a very easy-to-understand and approachable way - no complex jargon words, no unnecessary graphs or irrelevant theory. Having constantly tweaked this course for 7 years, I can now walk you a very well-refined path to learning just what you need to know, as simply as possible, with plenty of great examples etc. Read the reviews - people always come away inspired and full of new understanding. The summary clip-cards and course notes handbook also go a long way to maximising the ongoing value for my course, so you can refer to them either in times of need, or just when you&#39;ve got some time to kill and want to brush-up without having to stream the videos all over again.</li>

<p><strong>So let me ask you this...&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Will your investment portfolio grow much faster in the next 12 months after knowing how to trade with technical analysis ...</p>

<p>Do you have some money to invest?</p>

<p>Does your family need extra care or support?</p>

<p>Are you willing to learn a new skill that guarantees you a second income for the rest of your life?</p>

<p>Would you like to work less and make more?</p>

<p>I will assume your answers are the same as mine...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Then You Have 2 Clear Choices</strong></p>

<p>1. Keep doing things the way you have been and remain frustrated, lose money and simply get use to&nbsp;<strong>your average life</strong>...</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2. Enroll in Technical Analysis Fundamentals and start trading the smart way, quadruple your wealth and never worry about money ever again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Now You Have a Big Chance to Upgrade Your Trading Skills</strong></p>

<p><strong>Listen,</strong>&nbsp;if you don&rsquo;t get how important technical analysis is then don&rsquo;t enroll in this program.</p>
